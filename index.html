    <p>C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ is very similar to C. C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</p>
    <h3>Object-Oriented Language</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The procedural-oriented languages focus on procedures, with function as the basic unit. You need to first figure out all the functions and then think about how to represent data.<br>
      The object-oriented languages focus on components that the user perceives, with objects as the basic unit. You figure out all the objects by putting all the data and operations that describe the user's interaction with the data.<br><br>
      Object-Oriented technology has many benefits:<br><br>
      o Ease in software design as you could think in the problem space rather than the machine's bits and bytes. You are dealing with high-level concepts and abstractions. Ease in design leads to more productive software development.<br>
      o Ease in software maintenance: object-oriented software are easier to understand, therefore easier to test, debug, and maintain.<br>
      o Reusable software: you don't need to keep re-inventing the wheels and re-write the same functions for different situations. The fastest and safest way of developing a new application is to reuse existing codes - fully tested and proven codes.</p>
      <h3>Basic Terms</h3>
      <p><h5>o Object: </h5>An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.</p>
      <p><h5>o cout: </h5>It is a predefined object that is used to send data to monitor. Example: cout&#60&#60"Hello World";</p>
      <p><h5>o cin: </h5>It is a predefined object that is used to input data. Example: cin&#62&#62number;</p>

  <h3>Principles of OOPs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="li">Encapsulation:</span> In C++,classes are used to implement principle of Encapsulation.Encapsulation binds the data & functions together which keeps both safe from outside interference. Data encapsulation led to data hiding.</li>
    <li><span class="li">Data Hiding: </span>Data hiding is a process of combining data and functions into a single unit. The ideology behind data hiding is to conceal data within a class, to prevent its direct access from outside the class. It helps programmers to create classes with unique data sets and functions, avoiding unnecessary penetration from other program classes.</li>
    <li><span class="li">Abstraction: </span>Data Abstraction is a mechanism of hiding the implementation from the user & exposing the interface.</li>
    <li><span class="li">Polymorphism: </span>The word polymorphism means having many forms. Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance. C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.</li>
    <li><span class="li">Inheritance: </span>The technique of deriving a new class from an old one is called inheritance. The old class is referred to as base class and the new class is referred to as derived class or subclass. Inheritance concept allows programmers to define a class in terms of another class, which makes creating and maintaining application easier.</li>
